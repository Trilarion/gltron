This file tries to describe tracker's protocol.

The tracker is the main server that allows users to find a server where to play.

The tracker is listening on two ports: one for client connections, and one for servers connections. Servers need a passwd to connect to tracker,
Clients do not.
Server <-> Tracker communication:
-login : server establishes the connection and sends the passwd, if it is wrong the tracker will close the connection.
-ping  : tracker use a ping/pong system to know which server still alive.
-infos : whenever something changes on a server after it logged on, that server will send its information(Settings: speed,
size, erase; Description; Version; IP; Port; NbPlayers.)

Server 

Client <-> Tracker communication:
-infos : whenever something change on a server and after login, a server send its informations. Informations are: Settings: speed, size, erase; Description; Version; IP; Port; NbPlayers.

		Example of tracker, server and client architecture.
		__________________________________________________

When a client goes to a server, it disconnects from tracker.


Session example:
-tracker start;
-server A start;
-server A connect to tracker and logs in;
-client 1 starts and connects to the tracker;
-tracker sends server list to client 1(right now only server A);
-client 1 selects server A;
-client 1 disconnect from the tracker;
-client 1 connects to server A;
-client 1 plays;
-client 1 disconnects from server A and connects to the tracker;
-client 1 disconnects from the tracker and quits.

Gui:
Typically, we use a list. It can be a server list, scrollable, one line per server which contain these informations:Settings: speed, size, erase; Description; Version; IP; Port; NbPlayers. Arrows permit to select the server we want. Server list is ordered by ping. 

ping ideas/problems:
The client needs to ping all the servers (speed matters from his location, not the trackers), but the tracker does need to know if all the
servers are still online. the offline ones need to be discarded
