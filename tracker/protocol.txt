This file try to describe tracker's protocol.

A tracker is a server that allow users to find server where to play.

The tracker is listenning two ports: one for clients connections, and one for servers connections. Servers connection need a passwd to connect to the server. Client do not need it.

Server <-> Tracker communication:
-login : server establish the connection and send the passwd, if it is wrong, connection close.
-ping  : tracker use a ping/pong system to know which server still alive.
-infos : whenever something change on a server and after login, a server send its informations. Informations are: Settings: speed, size, erase; Description; Version; IP; Port; NbPlayers.

Servers still connected to the tracker all the time. What to do if tracker crash, reconnect?

Client <-> Tracker communication:
-infos : whenever something change on a server and after login, a server send its informations. Informations are: Settings: speed, size, erase; Description; Version; IP; Port; NbPlayers.

		Example of tracker, server and client architecture.
		__________________________________________________

When a client goes to a server, it disconnects from tracker.


Session example:
-tracker start;
-server A start;
-server A connect to tracker and login;
-client B start and connect to tracker;
-tracker send to client B server list, actually server A only;
-client B select server A;
-client B disconnect from tracker;
-client B connect to server A;
-client B play;
-client B disconnect from server A and connect to tracker;
-client B disconnect from tracker and quit.

Gui:
Typically, we use a list. It can be a server list, scrollable, one line per server which contain these informations:Settings: speed, size, erase; Description; Version; IP; Port; NbPlayers. Arrows permit to select the server we want. Server list is ordered by ping. 

ping ideas/problems:
the client need to ping all server? certainly udp ones or does the tracker do it for u but is that good?
