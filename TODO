TODO list

(name) reported it (contact for questions)
[name] plans to fix it (contact for updates/patches)

Bugs [high priority]:

- make sure all shadow stuff gets drawn with stencil on (if stencil 
  configured). make sure color is the same!

Features [high priority]:

- fallback instead of app exiting on corrupt mp3 files
- fallback instead of app exiting when SDL_sound is present, but doesn't
  support ogg/vorbis, or if sound fx files are corrupt
- stream music from disk instead of reading the whole file to memory
  (serious OS 9 problem, for example), this allows handling of large mp3 files
  too and gets rid of the fixed size buffer

Documentation & Packaging:

- decide about artpacks & sound & music included
- Tune diffuse / specular materials for the lightcycle, trail & recognizers
  [ nicolas, kokido ]
- compile decent ChangeLog
- document tools used. included 'sponsor' message for 3d exploration [ Andreas ]

Optimizations/Cleanups [high priority]

- look at #if 0,#endif and remove obsolete code
- check various TODOs, FIXMEs and #warnings in the code
- resolve this:
  The recognizer shadow suffers from z-buffer artefacts (Andreas)
  solutions: try to optain 24bit visual, don't zclear and change frustum for
  the recognizer, render recognizer shadow to texture, and project it onto
  floor & cycle / use stencil (UPDATE: Jon Atkins implemented stencilling,
  decide about defaults)

Features [medium priority]

- fast finish should be relative to the arena size (or really finish instantly)
- fix camera zoom generally (speed / settings)
- new bot AI
- add speed boost / variable speed
- Add new starting positions, e.g. 3 against one

Optimizations/Cleanups [medium priority]

- seperate game from engine a bit more
- delete the sound object in Audio_Quit to allow restarting the whole
  sound system without memory leaks

Bugs [low priority]:

- tweak LOD values so the lightcycle stays detailed within camera
  clamp range [ LIM ]

Features [low priority]:

- add (merge) software mouse cursor (from networking branch)
- add more special effects (reflections etc.)
- create default graphics settings to choose from: low/medium/high
- explosion is missing alpha blending right now
- Proper HUD for scores / ai info, etc.
- uv-coordinates for the model, add texture coordinate support to obj loader
- support other controllers (i.e. joysticks)
- quake-like drop down console
- add slightly funny console messages (Robot ate Andi's tail)
- peek left/right when in 1st person camera mode
- quick way to restore sane camera angle (e.g. middle mouse button)
- add armagetron style physics mod 
- add (merge) software mouse cursor (from networking branch)

Optimizations/Cleanups [low priority]

- Rework LOD system a bit.
- remove obsolete bitmap stuff
- Scale the mesh on load time, to avoid need for GL_NORMALIZE
- Rewrite trail handling code
- Remove all bitmap stuff
- dynamically load OpenGL (?)
- maybe rewrite save.lua, so .gltronrc is a bit more readable (and settings are
  grouped)
