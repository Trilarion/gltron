TODO list

(name) reported it (contact for questions)
[name] plans to fix it (contact for updates/patches)

Bugs:

- Make install doesn't work (Andreas) [ LIM ]
- tweak LOD values so the lightcycle stays detailed within camera
  clamp range [ LIM ]
- Zooming the camera doesn't work right after choosing 'Start Game' from
  the menu (Andreas)
- Screen garbled in-game after switching resolutions (hofi) (Note: works fine
  for me, anyone else experiencing problems? Andreas)
- the transparent part of the bow of the trail prevents other trails 
  from drawing in the same pixels (LIM) (Note: proper back-to-front drawing
  should take care of this. Andreas) [ won't fix ]
- save screenshots to somwhere else on UNIX. Users can't write to the
  dir where gltron is installed, usually. (LIM)
- fix pointer not showing up when game was started but not initially unpaused,
  but user went back to menu. (LIM) (software cursor time?)
- fix mouse not being released when going from fullscreen to windowed in some
  situations. (LIM)

Features:

- create default graphics settings to choose from: low/medium/high
- fix camera zoom generally (speed / settings)
- upon game start, default to split screen mode when there are multiple human
  players [ Todd ]
- Add 3d sound source for recognizer [ Andreas ]
- Add sound for own cycle. Modulate pitch (or volume) after turns
- Consider 'smooth turning' for other cycle sounds (doppler/panning)
- explosion is missing alpha blending right now

Settings:
- Tune diffuse / specular materials for the lightcycle, trail & recognizers
  [ nicolas, kokido ]
- glClearColor() doesn't match artpack. Move glClearColor to settings and
  include in artpack.ini [ Andreas ]
- Add trail & cycle shadow color to setting / artpack.ini [ Andreas ]
- Save current artpack / Clear up artpack system,
  Select default artpack [ Andreas ]

Documentation:

- add new default artpack author to CREDITS [ Andreas ]

Administrative:

- document tools used. included 'sponsor' message for 3d exploration [ Andreas ]

Optimizations/Cleanups

- Rework LOD system a bit.
- look at #if 0,#endif and remove obsolete code
- remove obsolete bitmap stuff
- Scale the mesh on load time, to avoid need for GL_NORMALIZE
- Rewrite trail handling code
- The recognizer shadow suffers from z-buffer artefacts (Andreas)
  solutions: try to optain 24bit visual, don't zclear and change frustum for
  the recognizer, render recognizer shadow to texture, and project it onto
  floor & cycle / use stencil (UPDATE: Jon Atkins implemented stencilling,
  decide about defaults)


Old TODO list, clean up when time available (priority):

(0) fix z-buffer problems (disable z-write on arena walls, adjust near on recognizer, etc.)
(0) look at cycle collision problem
(1) investigate framerate drop in win32 cycle collision test
(2) recognizer sound
(2) replay capabilities / fix demo recording / playback
(1) bug ShreadWheat about his point-of-interest ai technology
(2) make key pressed modifier immune (shift/capslock, etc.)
(2) generate uv-coordinates for the model
(1) fix back-to-front rendering
(2) work a bit more on line antialiasing (trail tops)
(2) make HUD configurable
(2) size HUD according to screen resolution
(0) investigate mipmapping artefacts under win32
(0) check USB keyboards. can't they record multiple key presses?
(0) change color values to something less yogurt-like
(0) check consistency of glEnable(GL_BLEND);
(0) add joystick code
(0) don't show resolutions that can't be accelerated (how can I know?)
(0) fix ugly console message passing
(1) implement networking
(0) fix bitmap bug to allow even faster software rendering
(0) write software mouse cursor
(0) move cycle behind posx, posy
(0) add more special effects (reflections etc.)
(0) check various TODOs in the code
(0) dynamically load OpenGL
(0) add slightly funny console messages (Robot ate Andi's tail)
(0) investigate halo
(0) proper documentation

bugs:
(2) demo playpack is broken after interrupt (Escape) 
(1) sound samples might overflow

possible bugs:
(0) failing malloc's arent caught, might lock up application/system
(0) some attributes are not saved to .gltronrc
