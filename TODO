TODO list

(name) reported it (contact for questions)
[name] plans to fix it (contact for updates/patches)

Bugs:

- tweak LOD values so the lightcycle stays detailed within camera
  clamp range [ LIM ]
- preferences/snapshot directory isn't created if it doesn't exist
- fix sound hiccup on exit (it's preventing e.g. restoring screen resolution)

Features:

- fast finish should be relative to the arena size (or really finish instantly)
- create default graphics settings to choose from: low/medium/high
- fix camera zoom generally (speed / settings)
- upon game start, default to split screen mode when there are multiple human
  players [ Todd ]
- Add 3d sound source for recognizer [ Andreas ]
- Add sound for own cycle. Modulate pitch (or volume) after turns
- Consider 'smooth turning' for other cycle sounds (doppler/panning)
- explosion is missing alpha blending right now
- Proper HUD for scores / ai info, etc.
- camera is not saved to ~/.gltronrc
- uv-coordinates for the model, add texture coordinate support to obj loader
- support other controllers (i.e. joysticks)
- quake-like drop down console
- merge software mouse cursor from networkign branch
- add more special effects (reflections etc.)
- add slightly funny console messages (Robot ate Andi's tail)
- rewrite save.lua, so .gltronrc is a bit more readable (and settings are
  grouped)
- peek left/right when in 1st person camera mode
- quick way to restore sane camera angle (e.g. middle mouse button, or press button, mouse mouse, release button, camera gets restored)
- fallback instead of app exiting on corrupt mp3 files
- fallback instead of app exiting when SDL_sound is present, but doesn't
  support ogg/vorbis, or if sound fx files are corrupt

Settings:

- Tune diffuse / specular materials for the lightcycle, trail & recognizers
  [ nicolas, kokido ]
- Add trail & cycle shadow color to setting / artpack.ini [ Andreas ]

Documentation:

- add new default artpack author to CREDITS [ Andreas ]
- add new programmers to CREDITS [ Andreas ]
- compile decent ChangeLog

Administrative:

- document tools used. included 'sponsor' message for 3d exploration [ Andreas ]

Optimizations/Cleanups

- Rework LOD system a bit.
- look at #if 0,#endif and remove obsolete code
- remove obsolete bitmap stuff
- Scale the mesh on load time, to avoid need for GL_NORMALIZE
- Rewrite trail handling code
- The recognizer shadow suffers from z-buffer artefacts (Andreas)
  solutions: try to optain 24bit visual, don't zclear and change frustum for
  the recognizer, render recognizer shadow to texture, and project it onto
  floor & cycle / use stencil (UPDATE: Jon Atkins implemented stencilling,
  decide about defaults)
- Remove all bitmap stuff
- check various TODOs and #warnings in the code
- dynamically load OpenGL (?)
