Installation

./configure
make

Type './gltron' to play!

Optionally do (as root):

make install

make install will install gltron in GLTRON_INSTALLDIR and some other files
in GLTRON_HOME as defined in the Makefile. By default, GLTRON_INSTALLDIR
is /usr/bin and GLTRON_HOME is /usr/share/games/gltron.

If the environment variable GLTRON_HOME is defined, it will look
there first, ./ second, /usr/share/games/gltron third and at last in
/usr/local/share/games/gltron. If you do a make install and have changed
GLTRON_HOME, you _must_ set the GLTRON_HOME environment variable.

You might also want to put the GLTRON_HOME environment variable into
your ~/.profile (bash) or ~/.tcshrc (tcsh).

Start gltron with the -s option if you don't want the sound playing.

These instructions are very brief. I'd be glad if someone could write
them better.
