GLtron has (if SDL_sound was comfigured correctly) now the ability to
playback mp3 files and other music.

Put your music in the data/music/ directory and prefix the song name with
'song_', e.g. 'song_aybabtu.mp3'. Use the arrow keys on the Audio->Song
menu item to cycle through the list (generated at startup).

Switching songs currently leaks memory and filesize is limited to 10 MB,
I'll see to fixing that in the near future.
