GLtron has now the ability to playback mp3 files and other music (if
SDL_sound was configured correctly).

Put your music in the music/ directory and prefix the song name with
'song_', e.g. 'song_aybabtu.mp3'. Use the arrow keys on the Audio->Song
menu item to cycle through the list (generated at startup).

Songs filesize is limited to 10 MB, and needs as much memory
I'll see to fixing that in the near future.
